**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, check out the
[Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

**Note:** If you are new to React, RxJS, and Redux, check out OG React documentation, as well as [TODO] this live React+Redux / Node testing workshop by Kent C. Dodds, showcasing [how a React+Redux and Node stacks work with TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdqiXcYDv-8).

Getting Started
-------------
The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# 0. Request for the .env file.

# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/nadinagerlach/espanola.git espanola

# Change directory
cd espanola

# Install NPM dependencies and run the app in development mode
npm i -s && npm run start

# Visit localhost:3000 on your browser to begin. The page will reload if you make edits.
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

```

### Building
- webpack ^3.x

`npm run build`

### Development
- webpack-dev-server ^2.x
- react-dev-utils ^4.x
- react-error-overlay ^3.x
- react-hot-loader ^3.x

`npm start`

### Tests
- jest ^22.x
- enzyme ^3.x

`npm test`
`npm run test:watch`

### Browser Automation
- nightwatch ^0.9
- selenium ^3.4

`npm run test:automation` (with dev-server already running)
`npm run test:automation:start` (start dev-server, run tests and exit)

A note on API Keys
------------------

To use any of the included APIs, you will need to obtain appropriate credentials: 
Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or Username & Password. You will need to go 
through each provider to generate new credentials. Don't forget to update your 
credentials when you are ready to deploy an app. If including on Github, we 
recommend using dotenv to protect your credentials from spammers.

- Visit <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook Developers</a>
- Click **My Apps**, then select **Add a New App* from the dropdown menu
- Select **Website** platform and enter a new name for your app
- Click on the **Create New Facebook App ID** button
- Choose a **Category** that best describes your app
- Click on **Create App ID** button
- In the upper right corner click on **Skip Quick Start**
- Copy and paste *App ID* and *App Secret* keys into `.env`
 - **Note:** *App ID* is **clientID**, *App Secret* is **clientSecret**
- Click on the *Settings* tab in the left nav, then click on **+ Add Platform**
- Select **Website**
- Enter `http://localhost:3000` under *Site URL*

**Note:** After a successful sign in with Facebook, a user will be redirected back to home page with appended hash `#_=_` in the URL. It is *not* a bug. See this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7131909/facebook-callback-appends-to-return-url) discussion for ways to handle it.

- Go to **Settings** tab
- Under *Application Type* select **Read and Write** access
- Check the box **Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter**
- Click **Update this Twitter's applications settings**
- Copy and paste *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret* keys into `.env` file

Deployment
------------------
Finished ripping for your own purposes? Here's an easy build & deploy pipeline with AWS. For the project to build correctly:

* **These files must exist with exact filenames**: `dist/index.html` (page template) && `dist/scripts` (JavaScript entry point).
* **Put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won‚Äôt see them.
* **Only files inside `dist`** can be used from `dist/index.html`

```sh
# Create the AWS S3; requires account at https://aws.amazon.com/free/
# Install AWS command line; requires

# Deploy static files from dist/ directory

# Optional: Add deploy script to package.json

## Build by bundling in production mode, optimizing for performance.  
npm run deploy

# Develop your app locally using `npm start`
# Then build, commit, & deploy ‚ôªÔ∏è
```
