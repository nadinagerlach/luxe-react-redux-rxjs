# Change directory
cd luxe-react-redux-rxjs

# Install NPM dependencies and run the app in development mode
npm i -s && npm run start

# Visit localhost:3000 on your browser to begin. The page will reload if you make edits.
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

```

A note on API Keys
------------------

To use Facebook's API, visit FB to obtain appropriate credentials. If including on Github, use dotenv to protect your credentials from spammers. :)

- Visit <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook Developers</a>
- Click **My Apps**, then select **Add a New App* from the dropdown menu
- Select **Website** platform and enter a new name for your app
- Click on the **Create New Facebook App ID** button
- Choose a **Category** that best describes your app
- Click on **Create App ID** button
- In the upper right corner click on **Skip Quick Start**
- Copy and paste *App ID* and *App Secret* keys into `.env`
 - **Note:** *App ID* is **clientID**, *App Secret* is **clientSecret**
- Click on the *Settings* tab in the left nav, then click on **+ Add Platform**
- Select **Website**
- Enter `http://localhost:3000` under *Site URL*

Deployment
------------------
Finished ripping for your own purposes? Here's an easy build & deploy pipeline with AWS. For the project to build correctly:

* **These files must exist with exact filenames**: `dist/index.html` (page template) && `dist/scripts` (JavaScript entry point).
* **Put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won‚Äôt see them.
* **Only files inside `dist`** can be used from `dist/index.html`

```sh
# Create the AWS S3; requires account at https://aws.amazon.com/free/
# Install AWS command line; requires

# Deploy static files from dist/ directory

# Optional: Add deploy script to package.json

## Build by bundling in production mode, optimizing for performance.  
npm run deploy

# Develop your app locally using `npm start`
# Then build, commit, & deploy ‚ôªÔ∏è
```
